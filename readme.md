# Orthographic Feature Transform for Monocular 3D Object Detection

![OFTNet-Architecture](https://github.com/tom-roddick/oft/raw/master/architecture.png "OFTNet-Architecture")
This is a PyTorch implementation of the OFTNet network from the paper [Orthographic Feature Transform for Monocular 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08188) and the repo https://github.com/tom-roddick/oft.  

The code currently supports training the network from scratch on the KITTI dataset.

_**Note:**_ Please use the dev branch for working model. The original repo in master is incomplete and cannot be used for training. This is for reference purpose only.
